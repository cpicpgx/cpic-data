Allele/cDNA/rsID (Required)	Allele nomenclature as described in the allele definition table
Activity Value (Optional)	Graded activity ranging from 0-1. The sum of activity values for maternal + paternal alleles gives a composite diplotype “activity score”. Most genes do not use activity value and activity score.
Allele Biochemical Functional Status (Optional)	The biological or biochemical activity or function of the allele as measured by, e.g. in vitro or in vivo assays, or other methods. This status may differ from the clinical function.
Allele Clinical Functional Status (Required)	Standard terminology [PMID: 27441996] for the clinically relevant function assignment for the allele used to distinguish clinically actionable alleles from non-actionable alleles (usually the normal function alleles). An allele is clinically actionable if, when present in the right gene dosage (e.g. homozygosity, in compound heterozygosity with another actionable variant, or combined with a normal function allele for a gene for which haploinsufficiency is actionable), prescribing decisions will be altered from normal (i.e. standard starting dose) prescribing actions. Refer to the "strength of evidence" column for strength of the evidence underlying the assignment of allele clinical function.
Allele Clinical Function Substrate Specificity (Optional)	Description of the clinical function of an allele towards a specific substrate which may differ from the clinical function of the allele towards the majority of substrates.
References (Required)	Support for the allele clinical functional status.
Strength of Evidence (Required)	The strength of the evidence underlying the assignment of allele clinical functional status. Definitive: The causal role of this allele in this particular drug phenotype has been repeatedly demonstrated in independent clinical studies and has been upheld over time (in general, at least 3 years). No convincing, adequately powered evidence has emerged that contradicts the role of the allele in the specified drug phenotype. Strong: There is strong evidence to support a causal role for this allele in this drug phenotype, including at least two independent clinical studies providing evidence for the allele’s role in drug phenotype in addition to at least one of the of the following: case report, in vitro data, computational activity predictions; Moderate: There is moderate evidence to support a causal role for this allele in this drug phenotype, including at least two of the following types of independent evidence: At least 2 patient cases demonstrating drug phenotype causality, in vitro data, at least one clinical study providing evidence for the allele's role in drug phenotype; Limited: There is limited evidence to support a causal role for this allele in this drug phenotype, including at least two independent studies based on the following types of evidence: a case report, in vitro data, computational activity predictions overall support in vivo and/or in vitro data. Computational activity predictions may be sufficient in unequivocal cases of early stop codon or complete gene deletions. Uncertain: Fewer than 2 patient cases with no convincing in vitro experimental data, with extremely limited or conflicting in vitro data. Unknown: There is no literature describing function.
Findings (Required)	Brief text summary of the findings from the literature that support or refute the evidence underlying each allele’s clinical function assignment
Comments (Optional)	Any additional notes about the allele.
